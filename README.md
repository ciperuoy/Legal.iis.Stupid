# ii's Stupid Menu
ii's Stupid Menu is a mod menu for Gorilla Tag, created by iiDk. This menu is designed to be as useful as possible by providing any variety of features and options you would ever need. With ii's Stupid Menu, you can explore new functionalities, experiment with different settings, and enjoy a more personalized modding experience. I modified this menu to allow for great pleasure of using this menu without cheating.
