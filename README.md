# Legally Stupid
Legally Stupid is a mod menu for Gorilla Tag, created by iiDk and modified by ciperuoy. This menu is designed to be as useful as possible by providing any variety of features and options you would ever need. With Legally Stupid, you can explore new functionalities, experiment with different settings, and enjoy a more personalized modding experience. I modified this menu to allow for great pleasure of using this menu without cheating.
